Linked Open Data
================

## Introduction

The aim of Open Data initiatives like [Open Data Euskadi](http://opendata.euskadi.eus) is to publish government data in the most interoperable and rich way, so that citizens and other institutions can build interesting applications and perform deep analyses. Linked Data offers a suitable technology to do so, through the so called Linked Open Data.

[![Five star Linked Open Data](img/5-star-steps.png)](http://5stardata.info)

The idea behind [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) is to publish data directly on the Web, using current technologies, with standards like RDF, OWL, and SPARQL. In order for such data to be useful, it must be identified with URIs, accesible through HTTP, and most importantly, linked to other Linked Data resources, to be a part of the Linked Open Data Cloud.

By publishing Open Data as Linked Data, 3rd parties (humans or programs) can browse the data through links and can perform interesting queries on integrated data.

In Open Data Euskadi, we have chosen data from different sources (Open Data Euskadi catalog, Legegunea, web content, etc.) and we have converted it to Linked Data. This documentation is provided to make the consumption of such data easier to developers, citisens, journalists, etc.

## Linked Data, RDF, SPARQL, OWL

## URI policy

In Linked Data, resources are identified by URIs. This means that URIs should be persistent and well defined (See references bellow for best practices on URI policies). We have followed the [NTI](https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2013-2380) scheme for URIs, with a caveat: instead of using the word "recurso", we are using the word "id" (Yes, we do know that a URI bears no semantics and therefore "recurso" is as good as any word, but we live in a community with two official languages and we think we should not favour one for the URIs). Therefore, you can expect the URIs at Open Data Euskadi to follow the pattern `http://{lang}.euskadi.eus/id/{sector}/{domain}/{ClassName}/{Identifier}`, where:

* `lang`: the language of the resource, one of `eu` (basque) or `es` (spanish). Open Data euskadi follows the architecture of the [DBpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/), in which datasets that pertain to different languages are stored in completely different servers.
* `sector`: one of the sectors provided by the NTI (e.g. `environment`).
* `domain`: the realm to which the resource belongs, defined by Open Data Euskadi (e.g. `air-quality`).
* `ClassName`: the name of the class of which this resource is an instance. In other words, the name of the resource at the other end of the `rdf:type` predicate (e.g. `observation`, from `http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#Observation`).
* `Identifier`: a unique identifier, generated from the original data (e.g. `AV-GASTEIZ-2017-01-26`).

So a real URI, identifying an observation of air quality that follows the [Data Cube](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) model, looks like: `<http://es.euskadi.eus/id/environment/air-quality/observation/AV-GASTEIZ-2017-01-26>`.

The URIs in different languages that refer to the same entity are related with an `owl:sameAs` predicate. That means that, in order to combine data in different languages, the SPARQL endpoints must be federated with the SERVICE keyword:

```
PREFIX owl:
SELECT *
WHERE {
<http://es.euskadi.eus/id/public-sector/administration/staff/inigo-urkullu> owl:sameAs ?s ;
 ?p ?o .
   SERVICE <http://eu.euskadi.eus/sparql> {
           ?s ?f ?g
   }
}
```

## Content negotiation

An important notion of Linked Data is that a URI identifies a resource (Iñigo Urkullu), but a resource can have different representations of the same content (An HTML page describing Iñigo Urkullu, RDF data describing Iñigo Urkullu, etc.). [Content negotiation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.4) is the process by which the server provides the appropriate representation for each client, according to the MIME type of the `Accept` header that the client provides (`text/html` for a web browser, `application/rdf+xml` for an RDF agent, etc.). 

The Content Negotiation at Open Data Euskadi is designed in the same way as in DBPedia. There is a URI with the token  `id` (`resource` in DBpedia), and the content negotiation process redirects the client with HTTP 303 codes to the appropriate URLs containing representations (`page` or `data` URLs). In the case of Open Data Euskadi there is an additional consideration since there are two types of pages: pages that represent only data (`doc`) and pages that represent web content that was transposed to RDF (`page`) (See Web content bellow).

The list of supported MIME types can be found at the [Blazegraph REST API documentation](https://wiki.blazegraph.com/wiki/index.php/REST_API#MIME_Types).

## Relation between Open Data Euskadi datasets and Named Graphs in the Triple Store

[Named Graphs](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#namedGraphs) provide a mechanism to organise RDF triples into meaningful groups, since a Named Graph is a collection of RDF statements identified by a URI. Named Graphs are useful to organise the data in a Triple Store, and they also offer the possibility of recording the provenance of data in triples, since the URI of the named Graph can be the subject of more (metadata) triples.

![Named Graphs at Open Data Euskadi](img/namedgraphs.png)

The Named Graph and metadata mechanism is used in this project to add provenance information to the RDF datasets generated from [Open Data Euskadi datasets](http://opendata.euskadi.eus/catalogo-datos/). Those datasets already have DCAT metadata, so the DCAT is "recycled" to obtain the metadata of the datasets that are created by converting existing Open Data Euskadi datasets to RDF (normally from CSV):

Detail of DCAT:


This means that SPARQL can be used to query data and metadata, using the DCAT graphs:

## Relation between Web content and Named Graphs in the Triple Store

Many webs of the http://euskadi.eus domain have been annotated with terms from the Schema vocabulary (http://schema.org), adding [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) snippets to them. Since JSON-LD is RDF, the content created for the webs is also stored in the Triple Store.
