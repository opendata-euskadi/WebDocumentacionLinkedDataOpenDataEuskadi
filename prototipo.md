Linked Open Data
================

## Introduction

The main idea behind Open Data is to publish government data in the most interoperable and rich way, so that citizens and other institutions can build interesting applications and perform deep analyses. Linked Data offers a suitable technology to do so, through the so called Linked Open Data.

The idea behind [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) is to publish data directly on the Web, using current technologies, with standards like RDF, OWL, and SPARQL. In order for such data to be useful, it must be identified with URIs, accesible through HTTP, and most importantly, linked to other Linked Data resources, to be a part of the Linked Open Data Cloud.

By publishing Linked Data, agents (humans or programs) can browser through links, like web browsing, and can perform interesting queries on combined data, since all the data is combined through links on the web.

In Open Data Euskadi, we have chosen data from different sources (Open Data Euskadi catalog, Legegunea, web content, etc.) and we have converted it to Linked Data. This documentation is provided to make the consumption of such data easier to developers, citisens, journalists, etc.

## URI policy

In Linked Data, resources are identified by URIs.
