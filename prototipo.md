Linked Open Data
================

## Introduction

The main idea behind Open Data is to publish government data in the most interoperable and rich way, so that citizens and other institutions can build interesting applications and perform deep analyses. Linked Data offers a suitable technology to do so, through the so called Linked Open Data.

In Open Data Euskadi, we have chosen data from different sources (Open Data Euskadi catalog, Legegunea, web content) and we have converted it to Linked Data. The aim of this document is to make the consumption of such data easier to developers and other citisens.
